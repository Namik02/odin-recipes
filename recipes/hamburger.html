    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A quick and easy hamburger recipe to make whenever you are feeling peckish and need a great meal</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef chuck or round</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Butter, as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the beef out of the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes before forming the patties. Form beef into three 5 to 6 ounce hamburger patties. Use your thumb to imprint a dimple into the middle of each burger. (This prevents the middle of the burgers from puffing up while cooking). Season both sides of the hamburgers with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a cast iron pan over medium heat. Cook hamburger patties 3 to 4 minutes on each side, depending on how well done you like it.</li>
        <li>Rest burgers covered loosely with aluminum foil for 5 minutes then serve on a buttered bun with lettuce, tomatoes and onion (or how you like it).</li>
    </ol>
